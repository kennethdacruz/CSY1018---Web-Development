            <p><b>Development of my website....</b></p> 
           <p>Once, I had a rough idea of what my website should like, I started developing my website. I started by creating the index page, which is my homepage, using grid to create the basic layout. Then I created a CSS file and developed the navigation for the website. I was then able to create the several pages of my website. Then I started experimenting with the different colours that I could use on the website, as the overall scheme. After carrying out this experiment several times, I came to conclusion about the colour that I would like to use on my website. To enhance my website I decided to use the colours that were in the same colour family. I chose to use the lighter shade as a background for the body of my page and a darker shade for the footer to make it stand out. I also set the background colour for the navigation and also set the colour of the text. I also added my social media icons to the footer and set their colour. Once, I was happy with my choice of colours, I used the same navigation layout and linked the .css file to the rest of my webpages.After I had done this, I made sure that the links to all the pages work. Then I decided to start making ammendments to my naviagtion, creating a effective drop down, where I grouped three of my pages together in a list. I personally believe this signficantly improved the appearence of my website. Furthermore, I also decided to added a border underneath the name of the webpage on the navigation. This is so that the users can very easily identify the webpage that they are currently on. Now I started working on the individual pages, starting with the homepage, where I added profile picture in the main top section and then experimented with the different displays such as flex and then justified the content, so that the image is centered. I also used align-items, so that the image is aligned to center along the cross axis. I also used the p tag to add a brief bio and introduce the site's purpose, in the bottom section, directly underneath the profile picture. Similarly, I went through each of the pages and use the grid concept to create the layout that I wanted and then used the relevant tags such as p tag for a paragraph, b tag to make a certain piece of text stand out and h tags such as h1,h2, h3 etc.. for headings, for example in a particular section. Once, I had a layout I started adding my actual content instead of the placholder text.</p>
