                <h3>Starting my website....</h3>
                <p>I started my website by creating a rough layout of what my website should look like using a online software called draw io. This really helped me clearly identify the different sections that my desktop wesbite will have. As you can see through the images I have clearly identied the different sections that my website will have such as the nav, header, main-top, main-bottom and a footer.I have used different colours to clearly differentiate between the different sections.</p>

                <h3>Development of my website....</h3>
                <p>Once, I had a rough idea of what my website should like, I started developing my website.

                <h3>Final touches....</h3>
                <p>Finally, once I had finished adding the content, I decided to experiment with and create keyframe animations. I decided to created a animated background and enhance my website, instead of just using one static colour for the background. Then, experimented with the different gradients, where one gradient, transitioned into another. I used infinite ease to create a smooth transition. The transition will start slowly, then quickly change to a lighter gradient and then slowly end the transition, by transitioning back to its original gradient. I also specied a specific duration, which was 8s. It smoothly transitioned to the specified gradients...</p>
