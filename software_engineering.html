             This was a group project. The key aim of this project was to develop very effective and efficient suite of products which includes:
            <ul>
            <li> 1.	A customer facing zoo website</li>
            <li> 2.	An internally facing visitor information technologies</li>
            <li> 3.	A zoo records administration/content management system that will allow key business records for the zoo to be effectively managed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The end goal of the project was that the three software products developed will very effectively resolve all the concerns of the client. We worked together as a group to carry out all the elicitation activities, such as effective interview plans for the client interviews and extract the key required information, including the functional and performance requirements for the three systems from the clients. We were then able to use the information obtained from the client interviews to develop effective solutions, screen mockups, for the three software systems which are: Record Management System, website, and the visitor information technology, such as a kiosk system and the Mobile Application. We spent significant amount of time on the screen mock-ups, making sure that we include all the functional requirements, outlined by the clients for the three systems.
