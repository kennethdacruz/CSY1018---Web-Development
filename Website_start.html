            <p><b>Starting my website....</b></p> 
           I really enjoyed this module. Started this module with no experience in html and CSS. I learnt a lot of skills that can be used in html and CSS, using the software application Visual Studio Code which I had never used before to develop this website itself. The development of this website was really interesting and challenging as it allowed me to experiment a range of techinques available such as animations, grids and other special effects to enhance my website. Although I found it really challenging at times to carry out specific tasks due to a range of errors, I was able to persevere until I had found a solution to it. I really liked the fact that I was able to implement my creative thinking to develop a draft layout for my website and then use my technical skills and a lot of experimenting, to develop a technical, functional website. I started my website with a basic grid layout and created the different sections that I wanted on my homepage.
