            <p><b>Starting my website....</b></p> 
            <p>First,I read the assignment brief and understood what the key requirments were, which was to develop a portfolio site with at least five pages. I started my website by creating a rough layout of what my website should look like using a online software called draw io. This really helped me clearly identify the different sections that my desktop wesbite will have. As you can see through the image I have clearly identied the different sections that my website will have such as the nav, header, main-top, main-bottom and a footer. I have used different colours to clearly differentiate between the different sections.I now have a very rough idea of what I want my final website to look like.</p>
