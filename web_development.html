          <p>I really enjoyed this module. Started this module with no experience in html and CSS. I learnt a lot of skills that can be used in html and CSS, using the software application Visual Studio Code which I had never used before to develop this website itself. The development of this website was really interesting and challenging as it allowed me to experiment a range of techinques available such as animations, grids and other special effects to enhance my website. Although I found it really challenging at times to carry out specific tasks due to a range of errors, I was able to persevere until I had found a solution to it. I really liked the fact that I was able to implement my creative thinking to develop a draft layout for my website and then use my technical skills and a lot of experimenting, to develop a technical, functional website. I started my website with a basic grid layout and created the different sections that I wanted on my homepage.
           Then I created a CSS file and developed the navigation for the website. I was then able to create the several pages of my website. Then I started experimenting with the different colours that I could use on the website, as the overall scheme. After carrying out this experiment several times, I came to conclusion about the colour that I would like to use on my website. To enhance my website I decided to use the colours that were in the same colour family.</p>
           
          <p>Once I had finished adding the content, I decided to experiment with and create keyframe animations. I decided to created a animated background and enhance my website, instead of just using one static colour for the background. Then, experimented with the different gradients, where one gradient, transitioned into another. I used infinite ease to create a smooth transition. The transition will start slowly, then quickly change to a lighter gradient and then slowly end the transition, by transitioning back to its original gradient. I also specied a specific duration, which was 8s. It smoothly transitioned to the specified gradients</p>
